// A number
// let n = 123;


/// A String
/// let str = "Hello";


//

//In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.

//Double quotes: "Hello".
//Single quotes: 'Hello'.
//Backticks: `Hello`.



// Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s no difference between them in JavaScript.

// Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:

let name = "John";

// embed a variable
alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); // Hello, John!

// embed an expression
alert( `the result is ${1 + 2}` ); // the result is 3


/// A boolean (logical type)
/// The boolean type has only two values: true and false.

let isGreater = 4 > 1;

alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")

let myAge = 21 > 56;

alert(myAge);

/// The “null” value

// It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.
